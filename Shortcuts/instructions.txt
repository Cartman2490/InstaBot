You can choose to launch the program in many different ways,

With NONE of the paramteres set:
(the program will pormpt you for username, password, etc...)
(Use this to choose the settings upon startup)
-->run.py

(the program will attempt to login with username and password, application will run)
(Use this to create custom tailored shortcuts to the application)
-->run.py <username> <password> <your .txt whitelist> <your .txt blacklist> <y/n>

With only a username and password:
(the program will prompt you for a whitelist, blacklist, then y/n)
